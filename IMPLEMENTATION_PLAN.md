# Implementation Plan: RAG LLM Interface Service & File-Watcher Sidecar

This plan outlines the recommended step-by-step approach to implement the system, leveraging LLM support and automation where possible.

## 1. Project Setup
- Initialize a Python project with virtual environment, requirements.txt, and Makefile.
- Set up version control (git) and CI pipeline (lint, test, build).
- Add Sphinx for documentation and configure doc build.

## 2. API Skeleton Generation
- Use openapi.yaml to auto-generate FastAPI server stubs (e.g., with openapi-generator).
- Implement basic API endpoints: /ingest/notify, /query, /admin/reset, /admin/reindex, /health, /status.
- Add OpenAPI/Swagger UI for interactive docs.

## 3. File-Watcher Sidecar
- Implement the file-watcher using Watchdog, supporting config via YAML/env.
- Implement batching, debouncing, and event verification (mtime/hash).
- Integrate with the API: send batched notifications to /ingest/notify.
- Add logging and error handling (retries, local queue).

## 4. Ingestion & Vectorization
- Implement ingestion logic: accept file events, read file content, chunk, and vectorize.
- Integrate SQLite with vector extension for embedding storage.
- Tag all vectors by project/tag EUID.

## 5. Retrieval & LLM Routing
- Implement retrieval logic: similarity search by project/tag, gather context.
- Implement LLM router: support local (Ollama) and cloud (Gemini) LLMs, with per-query and global config.
- Integrate LLM response formatting and citation support.

## 6. Security, Observability, and Admin
- Add authentication (bearer token, optional) and secure config handling.
- Implement structured logging, metrics endpoint, and health checks.
- Implement admin endpoints: reset, reindex, logs, metrics.

## 7. Testing & Documentation
- Write pytest-based unit and integration tests for all components and endpoints.
- Ensure 100% test coverage for critical logic (ingestion, retrieval, LLM routing).
- Document all modules with literate docstrings and Sphinx.
- Update README and usage guides.

## 8. Packaging & Deployment
- Create Dockerfile and update Makefile for build, test, and deploy targets.
- Provide a one-line install/run script for local onboarding.
- Document deployment options (local, Docker, CI/CD).

## 9. Review & Iterate
- Use LLMs for code review, refactoring, and optimization.
- Solicit feedback from users/contributors and iterate on features and docs.

---

For each step, leverage LLMs for code generation, documentation, and review as described in the SDD and CONTRIBUTING.md.
