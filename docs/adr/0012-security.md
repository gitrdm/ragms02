# Security and Data Privacy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The system may handle sensitive code, documents, and user data. For solo/local use, the risk is low, but future remote or multi-user deployments require stronger security. Data privacy and compliance (e.g., not leaking code or credentials) are important considerations.

## Decision
- For local/solo use, data is stored on disk and transmitted over localhost; no encryption is required by default.
- If deployed remotely or in a shared environment, enable HTTPS/TLS for all API endpoints to protect data in transit.
- Sensitive configuration (API tokens, credentials) must be provided via environment variables or secure config, never in source control.
- Logs must not contain sensitive data (e.g., file contents, secrets).
- The system is designed to support future enhancements (e.g., encrypted storage, audit logging, access controls) as needed.

## Consequences
- Simple and low-overhead for local use.
- Ready for secure deployment in production or shared environments.
- Developers must be aware of security risks if running outside localhost.

## Alternatives Considered
- Always require encryption (adds friction for local use).
- No security controls (not acceptable for remote/multi-user scenarios).
