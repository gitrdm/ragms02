# Deployment and Packaging

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The system should be easy to run locally for a solo developer, but also support containerized or server deployment if needed. Configuration should be simple, with environment variables and/or config files. Smooth onboarding and repeatable setup are important.

## Decision
- Provide a simple Python package and CLI for local use.
- Offer a Docker container for easy deployment on servers or in CI/CD.
- Support configuration via environment variables and YAML/JSON config files.
- Document requirements for Python version, OS, and dependencies.
- Provide a one-line install/run script for local onboarding.
- Use a `Makefile` with common targets (e.g., `make install`, `make run`, `make test`, `make docker-build`) to streamline setup, testing, and deployment for both local and server use.

## Consequences
- Easy for solo/local use and quick onboarding.
- Ready for server or cloud deployment if needed.
- Minimal friction for switching between local and remote/server modes.
- Makefile targets provide a consistent developer experience across environments.

## Alternatives Considered
- Only local scripts (limits future deployment).
- Only Docker (adds friction for local dev).
- Use of orchestration tools (overkill for solo use, but possible for future).
