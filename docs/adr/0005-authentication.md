# Authentication and Authorization

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The current use case is a sole developer running the service locally, so authentication is not enforced. However, future scenarios may require enabling authentication for remote, multi-user, or production deployments to protect sensitive endpoints and data.

## Decision
- No authentication is required by default for local/solo use, to maximize developer convenience.
- The API and client are designed so that bearer token authentication can be enabled with minimal changes if needed.
- If authentication is enabled, admin endpoints (e.g., reset, reindex, logs) must require a valid token.
- All authentication secrets (tokens, keys) should be provided via environment variables and never stored in source control.

## Consequences
- Simplifies local development and solo use.
- Reduces friction for getting started.
- Security risk if deployed in a shared or public environment without enabling authentication.
- Easy to add authentication later as requirements evolve.

## Alternatives Considered
- Always require API keys or tokens (adds friction for solo/local use).
- Use OAuth or mTLS (overkill for current needs, but possible for future production scenarios).
