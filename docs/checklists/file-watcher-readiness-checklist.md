# File-Watcher Implementation Readiness Checklist

This checklist is intended to help you determine whether you are ready to begin implementation of the file-watcher sidecar, or if additional architectural decisions (ADRs) or specifications need to be finalized first.

---

## ✅ Prerequisite: TDD & ADR Review

- [ ] System Design Document (SDD) is complete and reviewed by stakeholders.
- [ ] All ADRs affecting the file-watcher are either:
    - [ ] Finalized, or
    - [ ] Explicitly marked as not blocking implementation.
- [ ] All open questions in the SDD are resolved or deferred with clear TODOs.

---

## ✅ Safe to Prototype Now

- [ ] File event detection (create/modify/delete/move) requirements are clear.
- [ ] Include/exclude pattern and directory config requirements are specified.
- [ ] Batching and debouncing strategy is defined.
- [ ] Internal file change verification (mtime/hash) approach is agreed upon.
- [ ] Logging and error handling requirements are defined.
- [ ] Configuration source and override mechanism are defined (YAML/JSON/env).
- [ ] No external integration details (e.g., API request/response formats) are likely to change due to pending ADRs.

---

## ⚠️ Defer Until ADRs/Specs Finalized

- [ ] Ingestion API endpoint, payload format, and authentication/authorization method are not finalized.
- [ ] Security/compliance requirements (e.g., secrets management) are undecided.
- [ ] Deployment model (container, sidecar, CLI, etc.) is not agreed upon and could affect design.
- [ ] Platform support (Linux/Mac/Windows) requirements are still in flux.

---

## ✅ Next Steps

- [ ] If all items in "Safe to Prototype Now" are checked and "Defer" items are not blockers, begin implementation or prototyping.
- [ ] If any "Defer" items are blocking, prioritize finalizing those ADRs or specifications.
- [ ] Communicate checklist status to all stakeholders before starting significant coding work.
