# LLM-Assisted Project Workflow Template

This template outlines a robust, feedback-driven workflow for LLM-assisted software projects.

## 1. Requirements & Planning
- [ ] Write explicit, testable requirements and acceptance criteria.
- [ ] Identify stakeholders, use cases, and constraints.
- [ ] Choose libraries, frameworks, and tools (e.g., LangChain, FastAPI, SQLite).
- [ ] Draft initial ADRs and C4 diagrams.

## 2. Design Review
- [ ] Review ADRs, diagrams, and API specs using the design-review checklist.
- [ ] Link design artifacts to requirements and planned tests.
- [ ] Revise based on feedback.

## 3. Incremental Implementation
- [ ] Break work into small, testable increments (features, endpoints, modules).
- [ ] For each increment:
    - [ ] Implement code and update docs.
    - [ ] Add or update tests (unit, integration, E2E).
    - [ ] Run and review tests; fix issues.
    - [ ] Share results and logs with the LLM for review/debugging.
    - [ ] Update ADRs/docs as needed.

## 4. Integration & Validation
- [ ] Run integration and E2E tests.
- [ ] Validate against acceptance criteria and user stories.
- [ ] Review logs, error cases, and edge scenarios.

## 5. Documentation & Handover
- [ ] Ensure all code, ADRs, and diagrams are up to date.
- [ ] Generate or update user and developer docs.
- [ ] Provide quick start and usage examples.

## 6. Review & Retrospective
- [ ] Conduct a post-project review (what worked, what didnâ€™t, lessons learned).
- [ ] Update checklists, templates, and workflows for next time.

**Tips:**
- Use the LLM for code generation, review, debugging, and brainstorming edge cases.
- Share real errors, logs, and test results for best results.
- Keep all artifacts (code, docs, ADRs, diagrams) in sync and versioned.
